# PROGRESS
# 🚗 Vehicle Polymorphism Program

This Python project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as **classes**, **constructors**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism** using different types of vehicles.

Each vehicle type (Car, Plane, Boat, Bicycle) is modeled as a class that inherits from a base `Vehicle` class and implements its own version of the `move()` method.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Classes & Objects**
- **Constructors (`__init__`)**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism** (same method behaves differently depending on the object)

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user defines multiple vehicle classes (`Car`, `Plane`, `Bicycle`, `Boat`) inheriting from a base class `Vehicle`.
2. Each subclass overrides the `move()` method to print a unique message.
3. A shared `travel()` function demonstrates polymorphism by calling `move()` on any `Vehicle` object.
